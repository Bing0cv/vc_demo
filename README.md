# MeanVC: Lightweight and Streaming Zero-Shot Voice Conversion via Mean Flows

📑 Paper(coming-soon) |  🌐[Demo](https://bing0cv.github.io/vc_demo/)

MeanVC is a lightweight and streaming zero-shot voice conversion system that enables real-time timbre transfer from any source speaker to any target speaker while preserving linguistic content. The system introduces a diffusion transformer with chunk-wise autoregressive denoising strategy and mean flows for efficient single-step inference.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🚀 Streaming Inference**: Real-time voice conversion with chunk-wise processing
- **⚡ Single-Step Generation**: Direct mapping from start to endpoint via mean flows
- **🎯 Zero-Shot Capability**: Convert to any unseen target speaker without training
- **💾 Lightweight**: Significantly fewer parameters than existing methods
- **🔊 High Fidelity**: Superior speech quality and speaker similarity
